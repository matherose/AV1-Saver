.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec has gone through several iterations.  It was
originally written in \s-1HTML\s0 and later revised into \s-1POD \s0(though published
in \s-1HTML\s0 generated from the \s-1POD\s0).  Fields were added, removed or changed,
sometimes by design and sometimes to reflect real-world usage after the
fact.
.PP
This document reconstructs the history of the \s-1CPAN\s0 Meta Spec based on
change logs, repository commit messages and the published \s-1HTML\s0 files.
In some cases, particularly prior to version 1.2, the exact version
when certain fields were introduced or changed is inconsistent between
sources.  When in doubt, the published \s-1HTML\s0 files for versions 1.0 to
1.4 as they existed when version 2 was developed are used as the
definitive source.
.PP
Starting with version 2, the specification document is part of the
CPAN-Meta distribution and will be published on \s-1CPAN\s0 as
CPAN::Meta::Spec.
.PP
Going forward, specification version numbers will be integers and
decimal portions will correspond to a release date for the CPAN::Meta
library.
